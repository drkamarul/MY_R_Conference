# Cox proportional hazard regression (15 min)

Survival analysis is just another name for time to event  analysis. Regression is popular because plausible model can be fitted. 

In survival analysis, one method of analyses is the Cox proportional hazard regression. In survival analysis, the outcome variable (dependent variable) is TIME TO THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT or shortly known as the time-to-event variable.

## Survival data

In survival analysis, we follow a subject of interest until a certain time (the last follow up). Different patients will have different follow-up times.

For example, we observe a group of patients; with the outcome variable named as 'status' and the outcome coded as 'death' or 'alive'. The status at the last follow up, can be an event either of 'death' or of other than death - 'non-death'. 

The researcher must choose between 'death' and 'non-death to consider if the event of interest has occurred or not. If he chooses (interested in) 'death', then any patient (who is under the follow-up) who dies during the follow-up will be considered as a 'failure'. Any other patients who are under  the same follow-up and still survive until the latest follow-up is known as a 'censor' case.


In survival data, time (duration of follow up) is the 'survival time' (example months, weeks, days) and event is 'the failure status' (for example death, relapse and recurrence)

## Read data

Data comes from stroke patients. It is a stata format. 

```{r}
stroke <- read_dta(here('datasets', 'stroke_outcome.dta'))
```

Let's get a brief view of data

```{r}
str(stroke)
glimpse(stroke)
```

## Data wrangling

We would like to convert labelled variable to factors variables

```{r}
stroke2 <- stroke %>% mutate_if(is.labelled, ~as_factor(.)) 
glimpse(stroke2)
```

The data must have at least

1.  duration taken to develop event of interest (time variable)
2.  event of interest (event variable)

You can calculate the duration from the starting point (for example, date of admission, date of discharge) until the point of event occurs (for example, date of death, date of relapse)

```{r  censoring, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.cap='Types of censoring', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('image', 'censor2.png')) 
```

Figure \@ref(fig:censoring) shows types of censoring.

Censoring is a problem is the survival analysis. Censoring occurs when we know the survival time for an individual but we do not know the survival time exactly. The common causes of censor are:

1.  study ends - no event even after study ends
2.  lost to follow up - abscond
3.  withdraws

## Estimation

### The Cox proportional haazard regression

In medicine and epidemiology, the most used survival model uses the Cox proportional hazard regression. It is a semi-parametric model. This is because we do not specify the exact distribution of the baseline hazard.

The formula for Cox PH model $h(t,X) = h_0(t)\exp^{\sum_{i=1}^p\beta_iX_i}$

where $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard and $\exp^{\sum_{i=1}^p\beta_iX_i}$ is the exponential of the linear predictors.

### Null model

The null model contains no covariates.

```{r}
cox.null <- coxph(Surv(time = days, event = outcome == 'dead') ~ 1,
                 data = stroke2)
summary(cox.null)
```

### Conditional model

We include systolic blood pressure as the covariate

```{r}
cox.sbp <- coxph(Surv(time = days, event = outcome == 'dead') ~ sbp,
                 data = stroke2)
summary(cox.sbp)
```

Main effect model

The model the risk for death as a function of Glasgow Coma Scale and age. 

```{r}
cox.gcs.age.noia <- coxph(Surv(time = days, event = outcome == 'dead') ~ gcs +
                       age, data = stroke2)
summary(cox.gcs.age.noia)
```

Model with interaction

We add an interaction between gcs and age into our covariate. 

```{r}
cox.gcs.age <- coxph(Surv(time = days, event = outcome == 'dead') ~ gcs +
                       age + gcs:age, data = stroke2)
summary(cox.gcs.age)
```


## Inference

## Model checking

One of the most important assumption in Cox proportional hazars regression is the proportional hazard assumptions. 

### Testing the assumption of proportional hazard 

We can use `survival::cox.zph()`

```{r}
prop.h <- cox.zph(cox.gcs.age, transform = 'km', global = TRUE)
prop.h
```
